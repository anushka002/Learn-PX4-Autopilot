## What is PX4 Autopilot?
PX4 is an open-source flight control software used for drones and other unmanned vehicles. With PX4, you can simulate a drone's behavior in a virtual environment before testing it in the real world.

## Goal of This Course
In this beginner course, you'll learn how to:
- Set up a PX4 simulation environment.
- Run a basic drone simulation.
- Explore the tools and features of PX4.

This is the first step in a scalable learning journey—more advanced topics can be added later!

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- Basic familiarity with using a terminal or command line.
- A curiosity to learn about drones!
